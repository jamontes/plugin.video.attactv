Initial release 0.0.5

This XBMC plugin allows to watch the videos from the ATTAC TV web site.

The ATTAC TV web site has its videos hosted at several platforms, as Youtube, Vimeo, and BlipTV,
so this plugin requires those great three plugins from The Creative to be installed to work (don't worry if you
don't have them installed at the time of installation: XBMC will do it automatically for you). 

Through the Add-on settings you can configure the language prefered to watch the videos.
The ATTAC TV web site supports four languages (and so the plugin does): Spanish, English, French, and German.
If your GUI language is one of these, then you don't have to do anything into the settings to watch the videos,
except maybe to activate the subtitles with your prefered language into the Youtube video plugin. 

This is the first release of the plugin, so there are some sources for videos not yet supported, as those from the spanish RTVE.

To install it simply download the zip file, and then proceed as with any other plugin from XBMC:
 System->Settings->Add-ons->Install from zip file.

Any issues detected can be reported using this forum thread for support: URL

Enjoy it!
